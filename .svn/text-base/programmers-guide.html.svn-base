  <h1>Programmer's Guide to jTRACE</h1>
  <h2>$Date$<br>by Harlan Harris and Ted Strauss</h2>
  
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  
   <p>This document provides an introduction to the jTRACE implementation, for
   development, maintenance, and extension. 
    <UL>
      <LI>The <A Name="intro">Introduction</A> gives a high-level summary of the design.</LI>
      <LI>the <A Name="build">Build Instructions</A> describe how to build jTRACE from source,</LI>
      <LI>the <A NAME="">GUI Design</A> section describes how the GUI is put together,</LI>
    </UL>
    
      
   and the Files and Scripts section overviews how the XML schemas are used to 
   define file formats and scripts.  The jTRACE javadoc are generated from the
   code; javadoc gives full class specs, including variable and method 
   declarations.</p>
  
   <p>jTRACE is a Java 1.4.2 application with a GUI front-end and a XML-based
   file structure. </p>
  
  <h2>Build Instructions</h2>
  
   <h3>Install Netbeans and Java</h3>
   <p>jTRACE was developed in Netbeans 4.0, using version 1.4.2 of Java. It
   should be possible to build the application with any 4.X version of Netbeans
   and with Java 2 SDK 5.X. Sun has 
   <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp">a combined package 
   available for download:</a>. 
   Follow the usual installation instructions. Note that the Netbeans source
   assumes that you're using J2SE 1.4.2, and you'll have to make a small
   change before you can use this more recent version of Java to build. See 
   below.</p>

   <h3>Install Subversion (optional)</h3>
   <p>
   To access our source tree, you'll need to install 
   <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>. We're using a
   1.0 build of the subversion server, but you can probably use the most 
   recent client. On Mac OS X, try <a href="http://codingmonkeys.de/mbo/">
   this version</a>.</p>
   <p>
   You'll also need to install the Subversion plugin for Netbeans,
   <a href="http://vcsgeneric.netbeans.org/profiles/">here</a>.</p>
   <p>Ask the authors how/where the SVN server with the jTRACE source is.</p>
   <p>Alternatively, you can just download a copy of the source from the
   jTRACE web page, and ignore SVN entirely.</p>

   <h3>Confirm Java version</h3>
   <p>OK, you've now got a big source tree, and you're ready to use it with
   Netbeans. First step is to change the Java package information in jTRACE.
   Right-click on jTRACE in the projects or file window, then select Properties,
   then General, then change the Java Platform to Default Platform. (Or,
   if you've got J2SE 1.4.2 installed, you can create a new platform called
   J2SE142 and use everything as-is.)

   <h3>Set up libraries</h3>
   <p>
   jTRACE... Properties... Compiling sources... From there, you'll need to 
   create several new libraries by selecting .jar files from the libs directory.
   As follows:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>JAXB
    <ul>
	<li>lib/jaxb-impl.jar
	<li>lib/jaxb-api.jar
	<li>lib/jaxb-libs.jar
	<li>lib/jaxb-xjc.jar
	<li>lib/jaxp-api.jar
	<li>lib/endorsed/dom.jar
	<li>lib/endorsed/sax.jar
	<li>lib/endorsed/xalan.jar
	<li>lib/endorsed/xercesImpl.jar
	<li>lib/jax-qname.jar
	<li>lib/namespace.jar
	<li>lib/relaxngDatatype.jar
	<li>lib/xsdlib.jar
	</ul>
   <li>JaxFront
    <ul>
	<li>lib/castor-0.9.5.3-xml.jar
	<li>lib/commons-beanutils.jar
	<li>lib/commons-collections.jar
	<li>lib/commons-httpclient-2.0.1.jar
	<li>lib/commons-logging.jar
	<li>lib/jaxfront-core.jar
	<li>lib/jaxfront-dbm.jar
	<li>lib/jaxfront-swing.jar
	<li>lib/jaxfront-xuieditor.jar
	<li>lib/jgoodiesLF.jar
	<li>lib/jimi.jar
	<li>lib/log4j.jar
	</ul>
   <li>JFreeChart
    <ul>
	<li>lib/gnujaxp.jar
	<li>lib/jcommon-1.0.0-pre2.jar
	<li>lib/jfreechart-1.0.0-pre2.jar
	<li>lib/junit.jar
	<li>lib/servlet.jar
	</ul>
   </ul>

   <h3>Builds</h3>
   <p>
   At this point the project should build correctly! To run from within
   Netbeans, just hit Run. You can also make "official" builds and source
   packages by using the package/makepackage and makesrczip scripts.
   </p>
  
  <h2>Object Design</h2>
  
   <p><b>The following objects are in the Model directory:</b></p>
   
   <h3>TracePhones</h3>
   
    <p>The TracePhones class defines a number of static methods used to validate
    phonetic strings and TraceWords, to calculate phoneme representations in the
    input layer of the model, and to define phoneme continua.</p>
    
    <dl>
    <dt>@@@ methodName</dt>
    <dd>A brief text description</dd>
    </dl>
   
   <h3>TraceWord</h3>
   
    <p>A TraceWord is a tuple of phonetic form, frequency, and familiarity (which
    is not currently used).</p>
    
   <h3>TraceLexicon</h3>
 
    <p>A TraceLexicon is a simple class that maintains a set of TraceWords.
    It's currently implemented as just an array.</p>
  
   <h3>TraceParam</h3>
   
    <p>The parameters of a TRACE simulation are specified in a TraceParam object.
    These parameters include a TraceLexicon, an input string, and the numerous
    numeric parameters of the model.</p>
   
   <h3>TraceNet</h3>
    
    <p>A TraceNet is the core of the model itself. </p>
   
   <h3>TraceSim</h3>
   
    <p>A TraceSim is a wrapper around a TraceNet object. It stores the internal
    states of a TraceNet at each time step, for real-time display and for
    later analysis.</p>
   
   <h3>TraceSimAnalysis</h3>
   
    <p>A TraceSimAnalysis does LCR calculations based on a TraceSim object.</p>
    
   <h3>TraceGraph</h3>
   
    <p>A TraceGraph is a wrapper around (subclass of?) TraceSimAnalysis that also includes
    graph visualization preferences.</p>
   
   <h3>TraceScript</h3>
   
    <p>A TraceScript is an object that can iterate over parameters, create and
    run TraceSim objects, create derivative TraceGraph objects, export data to
    files, etc. It is described in more detail in the Files and Scripts section 
    below.</p>
   
   <p><b>The following objects are in the UI directory:</b></p>
   
   <h3>jTRACEMDI</h3>
   
   <h3>jTRACE</h3>
   
   <h3>ParametersPanel</h3>
   
   <h3>SimPanel</h3>
   
   <h3>GraphPanel</h3>
   
   <h3>ScriptFrame</h3>

  <h2>GUI Design</h2>
  
   <p>jTRACE uses a multiple-document-interface (MDI) approach. Documents are
   views of linked TraceSim, TraceParam, and TraceGraph objects. The TraceSim and
   TraceParam objects may be saved or loaded (see below) as .jt files. Each
   subwindow contains one tab for each of these objects.</p>
   
   <p>The scripting window (there can only be one) is separate from jTRACE 
   document windows. It is a view of a TraceScript object. There are tabs for
   the associated TraceParam object, for the main TraceScript object, and for
   a TraceGraph object that plots the compiled results. Additionally, the
   TraceScript object can request that the scripting window create new jTRACE
   documents (as above) from individual runs of the script.</p>
